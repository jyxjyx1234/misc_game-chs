                                     MJDEV

       an unofficial development toolkit for the Majiro virtual machine

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              SOURCE INSTALLATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements:

  GNU make
  Objective Caml 3.08 (http://caml.inria.fr)
  ExtLib 1.5 or later (http://ocaml-lib.sf.net)

(Note that at the time of writing ExtLib 1.5 had not been released. You'll need
the CVS version.)

The only supported build platform is Win32 + Cygwin.  Within this environment
you can use any of the three Windows ports of OCaml.  Non-Windows will require
trivial modifications to the makefile to remove the .exe suffixes, which are
currently hardcoded because I'm lazy.
